These shortcut scripts invoke commands within Adobe Photoshop's "Camera Raw" function set.
These commands provide quick and easy automated perspective correction.
This was created for the work I do in the real estate photography industry.
Follow the instructions in instructions.txt to implement these scripts

You can view the .jsx files in notepad to see the specific functions the commands use.

Close Photoshop
Place these in this folder ( Consult Google for MAC OS location )
C:\Program Files\Adobe\{Photoshop Folder}\Presets\Scripts

In Photoshop edit your keyboard shortcuts ( Edit / Keyboard Shortcuts )
Navigate to > File > Scripts > {Perspective Script}
Choose what you want your hotkeys to be

I prefer to use Ctrl+F9 through Ctrl+F12 which will replace other functions I don't use

If you use these keys they will function as follows:

Ctrl+F9 - "Perspective Auto" ( Photoshop will determine what needs fixed )
Ctrl+F10 - "Perspective Full" ( This is for straight on shots )
Ctrl+F11 - "Perspective Level Only" ( This will horizontally level a shot, perfect for drone photos )
Ctrl+F12 - "Perspective Vertical Only" ( This will be your most frequently used one, corrects only vertical perspective )

Enjoy!
